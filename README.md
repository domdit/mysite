# My Portfolio Website
This is a standard portfolio website. I focused most of my energy on css animations and deploying them via javascript. This website also has an admin page which allows me to update content without having to revisit the code.

# Frameworks
Flask - http://flask.pocoo.org/
Bootstrap -https://getbootstrap.com/

# Future Plans
I would like to incorporate either a video game or dynamic visual into the header using the p5.js library.
